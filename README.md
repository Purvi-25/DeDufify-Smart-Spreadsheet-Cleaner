## ⚠️ Limitations
 - 🧩 **Single column processing**

   Duplicate removal works on one specified column at a time.
 - 📊 **Large file constraints**

   Very large CSV files may cause slow performance due to browser memory limitations. 
 - 🧠 **Basic CSV parsing**

   Complex CSV cases such as:
     - Commas inside quoted values
     - Multiline cells
      
    may not be handled correctly.
  - 📄 **CSV format only**

    Currently supports only `.csv` files (Excel `.xlsv` is not supported yet).
  - 🕘 **No history or storage**

      Cleaned files are not stored or tracked after download. 

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- Multiple column selection
- Preview cleaned data before download
- History & downloads tab
- Drag & drop CSV upload
- Support for Excel (.xlsx)
